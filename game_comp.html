                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>
                        <b>Game Comp</b> is a programming competition where indidividuals 
                        or teams design and develop their own game, for <b>glory and prizes.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The competition spans over the <b>mid-semester break (3 weeks)</b>, being a good opportunity to take a break, have some fun making a game and potentially
                        create something to pad your resume with while your at it.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        There is a central theme that every game has to use, but it's open and up to each teams interpretation. No design documents or pretty code required, this isn't your homework. All we care about is your final product in all its glory and bugginess.
                    </p>

                    <p>Your submission should aim to incorporate our theme for the year. You do not have to strictly hold to the theme, rather, we encourage creative interpretations on it.

                        The theme for this year is: <h2>life</h2>

                    <p class = "center">Maybe you want to create a game about life and nature. Maybe one about the life of a uni student? Or maybe you want to create a dating sim between the cells in your body. The interpretation and creativity is up to you.

                            Each entry will be judged by a small panel. Ideally, we would like to play each of your games, but if your game doesn't compile easily or you don't think 5-10mins would really showcase your game you will be required to submit a video to highlight your game instead. <b>Source code</b> will need to be provided for all entries, but will <b>not</b> be scrutinized for code style. <br/><br>

                            <span class="card-title">Criteria</span>
                            The submissions will be based around the following criteria:
                            <ul class="dot-points">

            <h5>Your Work, Assets and Licensing</h5>
            <p><b>We want to see <i>YOUR</i> work!</b> You may have a great idea to recreate Asteroids, or have your own Overwatch, but we want to encourage you <i>away</i> from that. We want to see the coolest, most innovative design you and <b>your team</b> can create. Even if your game isn't finished in the end, it's the overall concept that has the most impact.</p>

            <p> As there are <b>real prizes</b> you can win, and we want you to showcase your work, you will need to take care with the assets that you use. Any images, music, libraries or similar that you may use, must be free for use, for commercial or non-commercial use. If in doubt, look at the licensing or email the link/asset with its license to competition@csclub.org.au. You can of course make your own assets if you want! </p>

            <p> Any submission you make, still belongs to you. <b>We are NOT going to steal it and claim it.</b> However, if we really like your submission, we may ask you if we can use your submission or video in future showcases.</p>
